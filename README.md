Hello, I’m Valeria! 

Currently studying the art of web development and perfecting my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

Join me on my journey to learn on building responsive and user-friendly web layouts,
understanding the fundamentals of web design and 
experimenting with modern frameworks and best practices

My current goals is to develop and improve my coding skills,
build a personal portfolio to showcase my progress and
contribute to open-source projects and collaborate with the developer community

When I’m not learning or coding, you can find me diving into a good book, painting, traveling, or crafting candles. 
I believe that creativity is essential in both life and code, and I’m excited to bring that perspective into everything I create.
