Hello, I’m Valeria! 

Currently studying the art of web development and perfecting my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

Join me on my journey to learn: 
Building responsive and user-friendly web layouts
Understanding the fundamentals of web design
Experimenting with modern frameworks and best practices

My current goals:
Develop and improve my coding skills daily
Build a personal portfolio and showcase my progress
Contribute to open-source projects and collaborate with the developer community

When I’m not learning or coding, you can find me diving into a good book, painting, traveling, or crafting candles. 
I believe that creativity is essential in both life and code, and I’m excited to bring that perspective into everything I create.
